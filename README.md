**DNSToHosts**

DNSToHosts is a simple Windows desktop tool I made to enable you to quickly create a hosts record for a list of domains. In light of [recent DDoS attacks](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/internet-outage-ddos-dns-dyn/) on DNS infrastructure, it could be handy to be able to easily create a local hosts file for sites you use frequently to fall back to in the event of a DNS outage.

This was thrown together in about an hour, so I don't make any promises about the quality of the code, but there's really not much to it and it seems to work fine. Enjoy!
